# Kickoff

Simple starter repository. Add your project source, workflows, and documentation as you build.

## Getting started
- Update this README with project goals, setup, and usage once code is added.
- Keep credentials out of version control; use environment files ignored by `.gitignore`.

## Development
- Follow your preferred tooling; common ignores for Node, build outputs, and IDE files are preconfigured in `.gitignore`.
- Create initial meta/docs as needed to track decisions and conventions.
